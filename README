This is not a real application, it a sample maven template for deploying
a few war and jar files into tomcat, it is also not complete but centered around
the problem of deploying a few wars and their dependencies.

the sample is made of two main applications with submodules, kuku and kiki.

the structure is:

main-reactor -
    main-parent - (parent for all sub modules)
    tomcat-deploy - (module to install tomcat)
    kiki-reactor -
        kiki-core - (parent is main-parent)
        kiki-web - (parent is main-parent)
    kuku-reactor -
        kuku-core - (parent is main-parent)
        kuku-web - (parent is main-parent)




what it tries to achieve:

home -
    app -
       lib -
            all jars go here
       webapp -
            all wars go here, exploded
    tomcat -
        tomcat installed here



Behaviour should be:
deploy is by explicitly activating a deploy profile.
if running maven from the top most reactor everything should be deployed.
if tomcat does not exists it should be installed.
if running from a second level reactor everything under it should be deployed.
if running a single module only it should be deployed.
deployment includes all dependencies.
all jars should go to the lib folder.
all wars should go to the webapp folder, exploded.
the exploded wars should not contain their dependencies under WEB-INF/lib.

we would like:
1) that dependencies are copied more then once,
    for example all projects depend on log4j,it will be copied to the lib folder for every
    sub module, hopefully overriding each other with the same file.

2) we don't want to touch every sub module pom,
    if a sub module is added it should be deployed automatically when invoking the deploy profile.



current implementation (please fix if you change something):
all submodules inherit from main-parent.
a 'deploy' profile in main-parent does the job of copying wars and jars to their
    deploy location.
a tomcat-deploy module installs tomcat, it is activated by the 'deploy' profile.

see the source, and issues.
